      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The accuracy of this <b>asphalt calculator</b> (also known as a
        tarmac calculator) is proportionate to the accuracy of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/measurement">measurements</a>
        you enter. Ensure accurate measurements for accurate estimates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Road builders, constructors and homeowners, often need to estimate the
        amount of Hot Mix <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/asphalt-material">Asphalt</a> (HMA) required to cover a specific area. Our
        asphalt calculator (also known as a tarmac calculator) is a valuable
        tool for this purpose. The calculator uses a standard asphalt density of
        145 lbs/ft3 (2322 kg/m3), which may vary slightly depending on the
        specific asphalt mixture you purchase.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s get started!</p>
      <h2 class="mt-3">The calculation process:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Estimate the volume of asphalt needed:</b> Use geometric formulas
          and project plans or measurements, including width, length, and depth
          (thickness).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Estimate the density of the hotmix to be used:</b> The standard
          density for asphalt is 145 lb/ft3 (2322 kg/m3).
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiply the volume by the density (in the same units) to get the
          weight.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-3">The calculator formula applied in Asphalt Calculator:</h2>
      <p>
        A simple formula is applied  to <b>Asphalt Calculator</b> for estimate the asphalt volume and weight required:
        Volume (cubic feet) = Area (length × width) × Thickness Weight = Volume
        × Asphalt Density (145 lbs per cubic foot)
      </p>
      <p>Inputs You’ll Need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Area Dimensions:</b> The length and width of the project area (in
          feet or meters).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Thickness:</b> The desired depth of asphalt (in inches or
          centimeters).
        </li>

        <li><b>Asphalt Density:</b> Typically 145 lbs/ft³ or 2,320 kg/m³.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This <b>asphalt calculator</b> supports measurement units such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/inch">inches</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/feet" >feet</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/yard">yards</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre">meters</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre">centimeters</a>. Since measurements aren't always
        precise, and there can be waste during the application process, it's
        advised to purchase 5-6% more asphalt than estimated. This helps ensure
        you don't run out of material. For example, if the asphalt calculator
        indicates you need 10 tons of asphalt, purchase 10.5 or 11 tons to be on
        the safe side and avoid additional overhead costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For complex measurements, like irregularly shaped areas, simply divide
        the area into several regular-shaped sections. Then, calculate the
        volume and asphalt requirements for each section using the calculator
        and sum them up. If you need to do this for many sections, consider
        using a summation calculator. For slightly irregular shapes, you can
        make reasonable approximations by taking the average length or width.

      <h2 class="mt-3">Asphalt basics & applications</h2>
      <p>
        Asphalt is a black, sticky, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form
        of petroleum. It is found naturally, but more commonly results from
        refinement and is classified as a pitch. Asphalt is highly recyclable,
        offering both cost savings and environmental benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asphalt (tarmac) is widely used for road surfaces, including highways,
        inner-city and inter-city roads, local roads, car parks, driveways, and
        pavements. These are the primary reasons people use our calculator. It's
        estimated that around 94% of the 2.6 million paved roads in the U.S. are
        made from asphalt. You can also find asphalt on racetracks, tennis
        courts, and dams. Given its water resistant nature, it’s ideal for cable
        and pipe coatings and general waterproofing. Asphalt is used in
        bituminous waterproofing products, where it's a component of roofing
        felt and is used for sealing flat roofs. Bitumen has other valuable
        qualities, including durability, high traction, and low light
        reflectivity.
      </p>
      <img
      alt="asphalt calculator"
      src="/assets/images/new-image-1.webp"
      class="rounded img-fluid mb-3"
      style="height: 600px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover"
    />
      <p>
        In road construction, asphalt typically serves as a binding agent in
        asphalt concrete production. Bitumen is mixed with fine and coarse
        aggregates, such as sand, gravel, and crushed rock. Recycled polymers
        (e.g., recycled rubber tires) may be added to the hot mix asphalt to
        modify its properties depending on the intended application.

      <h2 class="mt-3">Types of asphalt</h2>
      <p>
        There are more than one type of asphalt, primarily differentiated by the
        mixing temperature. Selecting the right type is crucial, and calculating
        its requirement basis the density more important.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)</li>
        <li>Warm Mix Asphalt</li>

        <li>Driveway Mix Asphalt</li>
        <li>Porous Asphalt</li>

            <td>Also known as "Dense-Graded Mix," this is the most widely used asphalt type, ideal for all traffic conditions, road surfacing, and repairs. HMA offers excellent friction and durability. The binder is heated at high temperatures to remove moisture and ensure a proper mix. This type closely matches the asphalt density used in most calculators.</td>

            <td><strong>Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA)</strong></td>
            <td>Used in approximately one-third of road-paving projects, WMA is produced at lower temperatures than HMA. It is ideal for paving in off-season months, during nighttime projects, and in environmentally sensitive areas due to reduced emissions and energy consumption.</td>

          <tr>
            <td><strong>Porous Asphalt</strong></td>
            <td>Designed for superior water drainage, this mix consists mainly of crushed stone with minimal sand content, making it highly permeable. It eliminates the need for additional drainage systems. Though more expensive, it is environmentally friendly and helps prevent water pooling and runoff issues.</td>

      <h2>What is a Tarmac Calculator?</h2>
      <p>
        A tarmac calculator is a specialized tool that determines the quantity
        of tarmac required for a given area based on its dimensions and the
        desired thickness. By entering details such as length, width, and depth,
        you can get an accurate material estimate.

      <h3 class="mt-3">1. Can I use this calculator for a variety of asphalt projects?</h3>
      <p>Yes. This can be used for multiple projects ranging from small driveways and pavements to bigger commercial projects like roads and dams.</p>

      <h3>2. How can I calculate the cost of asphalt?</h3>
      <p>You simply need to input the price per unit of mass or volume as per your chosen measurements, in the calculator. After this, you’ll get your approximate project cost.</p>

      <h3>3. What is the required base thickness?</h3>
      <p>For many properties, a 3" base of asphalt on top of a 4" to 6" deep base of crushed gravel might be a reasonable alternative to using full-thickness asphalt. For parking lots, it should be an 8’’ crushed gravel base.</p>

      <h3>4. How many types of Asphalt can I choose from?</h3>
      <p>You can choose asphalt from mainly 5 types of asphalt, including hot mix asphalt, warm mix asphalt, cold mix asphalt, porous asphalt, and asphalt concrete.</p>

      <h3>5. Which units are appropriate for input measurements?</h3>
      <p>There are suitable units for length, area, depth, and density in the calculator for diverse project requirements. </p>
